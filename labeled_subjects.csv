This was a first for me.
I saw two interesting cyber detection jobs that would allow me back into the “hands-on keyboard” world that I love so much. I was excited to apply, took the “Doctor” and “Senior” off my resume, and fired off an application to their respective applicant tracking systems (ATS). After uploading my resume, I then had to retype the entire thing into various fields and reformat for visibility.  Evidently, the AI they are using isn’t that smart yet.  I answered the questions and hit submit, feeling good about my prospects.

Within hours, I received replies from each company.  At first, I thought, “Wow! That was fast for the follow-up gatekeeper questions.”  But my excitement was quickly deflated.  Both emails said, “Thanks, but no thanks, we’ve looked at your resume and don’t think you can do what we need.” 
I’ve received many such messages over the past six months.  I know that I will receive more after October 4th, but these two hurt me to my core. Ouch! 
I have held my Doctorate in Cybersecurity for one year and a Master’s in the same field for eight years. I’ve held many jobs in the networking and cybersecurity fields and have broad knowledge across nearly every side of the discipline, down to clearing registers in assembly language.  I always say that my knowledge is “a mile wide and an inch deep,” but that sells me short.  My exposure to most sides of networking and cybersecurity is vast. I say this not to brag, but to say that if I am not an expert in a specific application or concept, I can most likely get up to speed fairly quickly.  For example, I have always mentored young IT networking professionals to learn the basics of networking, routing, and switching. Once they know these core disciplines,  it will not be hard for them to pick up and configure almost any networking device. 
Despite this, it feels nearly impossible for an experienced cyber subject matter expert (SME) to pivot from one role in cybersecurity to another. The ATS filters us out, the hiring manager doesn’t find the exact keyword in our resume, or an interviewer passes us over because we forgot to name a specific step in the Intelligence Cycle, even if we’re intimately familiar with it. I know this is common practice as I’ve been on government hiring boards and was told to mark people down if they did not mention a specific word or phrase  
Your certifications, degrees, or experience mean nothing if one key word is missing or experience with a specific application is missing from your resume. 
Is this fair?  No. But this is the job market that thousands of us are facing, and it is soul-crushing. 
The Wild West of the Early Internet
Thinking back on my own skills….I started an Internet Service Provider (ISP) business back in the 90s, learned networking and Linux on my own, and dove headfirst into the world of selling Internet access. I wrote a LinkedIn article five years [ https://link.sbstck.com/redirect/3eeaf8ca-8850-45e0-a36e-c8393243caa9?j=eyJ1IjoiM2Nvd3cyIn0.gBvAYq-JWuxryCpqSAq7s4DN-5PW_O4Y8XoOyZ09efo ] ago that I just remembered, which presents details that I don’t mention below.  To be honest, I forgot that I wrote that article. I may have gotten things mixed up between the two, so don’t be surprised if there are slight discrepancies.
Fortunately, archive.org [ https://link.sbstck.com/redirect/75cb1a50-ca89-4c05-b145-51ba7fe25597?j=eyJ1IjoiM2Nvd3cyIn0.gBvAYq-JWuxryCpqSAq7s4DN-5PW_O4Y8XoOyZ09efo ] has an evolution of our home page from those days.  Here is one of the first. 
From Modems to Missiles
I had no idea how to wire up an RJ-45 connector using the T-568B spec [ https://link.sbstck.com/redirect/e3948eac-b082-4305-bc8e-1ffaa9d0a4de?j=eyJ1IjoiM2Nvd3cyIn0.gBvAYq-JWuxryCpqSAq7s4DN-5PW_O4Y8XoOyZ09efo ]  (orange/white, orange, green/white, blue, blue/white, green, brown/white, brown).  It did not matter at first because 100BaseT was still very popular.  I piled up O’Reilly books and learned so much from my ISP days. My first Linux distro was Yggdrasil [ https://link.sbstck.com/redirect/7a0abfb3-0c0f-41df-b6ce-74efeb5b9850?j=eyJ1IjoiM2Nvd3cyIn0.gBvAYq-JWuxryCpqSAq7s4DN-5PW_O4Y8XoOyZ09efo ] with kernel version 0.98.  We had to compile the kernel ourselves after making a few changes in the config.h file before running make.
It was so much fun back in those early days.  I had a stack of sixteen, 33.6Kbps Supra modems that we purchased from who knows where. We bought a Livingston Router and Portmaster serial/modem appliance, a switch, and an Adtran DSU, and I learned RADIUS, DNS, Sendmail, USENET, and POP3 on my own. I am sure many of my readers can recall those days.  
I’ll point out RADIUS to  my #infosec readers.  Let me know if you see anything off about a typical user’s setup in the RADIUS users file.
kelly   Cleartext-Password := “mypassword”
            Service-Type = Framed-User,
            Framed-Protocol = PPP
Yes, we asked our customers to give us their passwords, which we also used for their POP3 email accounts.  We stored them unprotected in the users file.  This was the wild west.
I set up an NCSA-HTTPd web server and leased a T1 line that terminated in my parents’ unfinished basement in rural Virginia, probably one of the first installations of its kind in Virginia. Centel (Sprint) was our last-mile provider, and we used MCI for Internet connectivity. I recall pricing was around $2,400 for a T1 (1.544 Mbps). I realized fairly quickly that our stack of 16 modems would never need a full T1, so we switched to a fractional T1. But we learned the hard way.
I discovered our first system hack when someone leveraged a WU-FTP server vulnerability, got into my Sendmail server, snagged usernames, and started sending emails to all of my customers! The local police department had never seen such a case of computer crime (this was probably around 1997). Nothing ever came of it, but I learned about “patching” and keeping up with the latest security releases of all of our applications manually. I cannot remember the mastermind’s name, but I do remember seeing them several years later when they were a student at state university. In other words, it was a local kid.  
I remember attending ISPCon (Baltimore 1998 [ https://link.sbstck.com/redirect/d70dacd4-d110-4e55-bb80-f6a2a5154619?j=eyJ1IjoiM2Nvd3cyIn0.gBvAYq-JWuxryCpqSAq7s4DN-5PW_O4Y8XoOyZ09efo ]) and seeing all of the goodies being sold to ISP owners like me. And, there was SWAG back then. I still have my ISPCon bag from Baltimore. One way to describe ISPCon is that it could be thought of as an ancestor of today’s Blackhat conference. It was an evolution from the world of the dial-up BBS server to TCP/IP Internet access, and very exciting for us geeks.
If I recall correctly, ISPCon was the first place that I saw the Carrier Class US Robotics Total Control modem appliance.  It was rack-mounted with T1/PRI ISDN cards and numerous 56K modems and ISDN cards.  It was a glorious piece of hardware. 
We ended up buying two for our ISP when our rack of 48 or so external dial-up modems became too hard to handle.  Imagine a rack with numerous dial-up modems on each shelf, with phone lines and serial cables running to each modem, with each modem screaming and sounding off connections from dial-up customers. We could tell from the tones whether they got a 56Kbps connection (highly desired) or not.  
The rack was a carpeted, horrendous mess; the room was hot and not designed for racks.  I remember the Movin’ Cool unit we bought that would shoot cool air into the room after pulling the moisture out of the air.  In the beginning, we had to empty its water reservoirs several times a day. One day, my youngest child walked right into that server room and pushed the power button on my Sendmail/POP server. I remember spending hours cleaning it up and restoring it to operation.  Routine back-ups were not common in my shop, so you can imagine my consternation when it was down and customers called in about their Eudora [ https://link.sbstck.com/redirect/36a792cd-c050-4e93-9349-3fbfbe361f83?j=eyJ1IjoiM2Nvd3cyIn0.gBvAYq-JWuxryCpqSAq7s4DN-5PW_O4Y8XoOyZ09efo ] mail not working. By then, we had a thousand customers and maybe two T1s worth of phone lines (24 lines per T1) coming into the server room.
If I recall correctly, while we were in talks to sell our business, Cornerstone Networks (CStone) helped us buy a brand new US Robotics Total Control system, or at least add one more to our inventory.  I remember unpacking this Total Control Hub.  It was awesome and really cleaned things up, allowing remote administration access using a GUI and digital ISDN modems.  To me, it was like owning a Corvette, complete with the high cost. A fully loaded Total Control hub could easily cost over $60,000. 
I loved working for myself, but I was a tough boss and put in many long hours while still working a full-time job writing software for the Tomahawk Missile Launch Control System [ https://link.sbstck.com/redirect/40d31d7f-16d7-4cd7-aa23-e9212bf71308?j=eyJ1IjoiM2Nvd3cyIn0.gBvAYq-JWuxryCpqSAq7s4DN-5PW_O4Y8XoOyZ09efo ]. I can still remember performing tech support from our townhouse in Fredericksburg, Virginia. Helping customers recall their passwords was a popular problem to deal with. Other problems were getting the fastest download speeds possible.  I cannot count how many times customers complained of being disconnected or slow download speeds.
One of the tweaks at the time was to have the user set up their modem to use COM2 port to avoid conflict with other onboard devices. This involved moving a jumper on the actual modem card or flipping a DIP switch. Some settings could be adjusted on the modem by using AT commands, like flow control, compression, and serial port speed.  We tried to squeeze all that we could out of our dial-up modems back then.
Before Microsoft Windows had support for Dial-Up Networking, we distributed a Netscape web browser and Trumpet Winsock on a floppy disk to new customers. Trumpet Winsock was used as the TCP/IP stack until Windows 95 brought a native dialer.  I remember the fanfare when Microsoft introduced the Internet Explorer Administration Kit (IEAK) to automate the setting up and customization of the Internet Explorer web browser, which they developed to compete with Netscape.
Anyhow, I sold that ISP when it became too much to handle, with over 1,000 dial-up customers and me being the only technical person around. Before the Internet bubble popped, I worked for the ISP that bought mine, CStone, out of Charlottesville, and their eventual owner, nTelos [ https://link.sbstck.com/redirect/0c4c0f2c-37ef-4197-9c9d-5444199e58d4?j=eyJ1IjoiM2Nvd3cyIn0.gBvAYq-JWuxryCpqSAq7s4DN-5PW_O4Y8XoOyZ09efo ].  CStone was a start-up business run by three super-smart guys, one of whom was a fellow Hokie [ https://link.sbstck.com/redirect/288a9ccd-19e9-4843-930a-617524d509dd?j=eyJ1IjoiM2Nvd3cyIn0.gBvAYq-JWuxryCpqSAq7s4DN-5PW_O4Y8XoOyZ09efo ], just off the downtown open-air mall.  We had some sharp folks there, including a system administrator who taught me a lot about FreeBSD and the concept of hardening servers from attack. After CStone bought my business, if I remember correctly, they bought another ISP or two before their eventual sale.  These were fun times!
I was a lead engineer when Cornerstone bought its first 1 TB server for our USENET feed storage. Can you imagine paying $30K for 1 TB worth of hard disks?  I recall the total cost being somewhere around that number and probably barely enough to contain all the pictures and binaries that were sent around on USENET at the time.
With Ntelos, an awesome company at the time, I learned even more and became the lead IP engineer over their multi-state network. I learned Border Gateway Protocol [ https://link.sbstck.com/redirect/39a2c62c-bd76-4a6e-b9ad-4f2c2e2e5089?j=eyJ1IjoiM2Nvd3cyIn0.gBvAYq-JWuxryCpqSAq7s4DN-5PW_O4Y8XoOyZ09efo ] (BGP) on the job, trying to balance the Internet load (numerous DS3s, which were 45 Mbps or so). I took a Cisco class at the local community college and received my Cisco Certified Networking Associate (CCNA) certification. I was a big shot…in my own head!
Ntelos continued buying ISPs, and we continued integrating them into our network.  Also,  competitive local exchange carriers [ https://link.sbstck.com/redirect/315bcc19-dea5-4046-b016-583e3ab4aea2?j=eyJ1IjoiM2Nvd3cyIn0.gBvAYq-JWuxryCpqSAq7s4DN-5PW_O4Y8XoOyZ09efo ] (CLECs) became profitable at this time.  Why buy your modem phone lines from the local phone company when you can operate your own phone company? In Virginia, one had to get permission from the State Corporation Commission and probably the FCC to operate as a CLEC. This was not a cheap or easy process. I remember traveling down to Abington, in southwest Virginia, as Ntelos looked at integrating one of the ISPs turned CLECs in the region.  My competitor in Halifax, Virginia, owned by a UVA graduate, was smart enough to convert their ISP business into a CLEC themselves instead of selling out. I believe they are still in operation today.  Despite being me being a Hokie, I’m proud of them. They, too, proved that rural Virginia has some smart people.
There is a part two here. I got the entrepreneur itch and left another perfectly good job to start an ISP that offered wireless broadband service in Halifax, Virginia.  That’s another story.
Why Experience Still Matters
I’ve never had enough time during an interview or room on my resume to show off my technical acumen. And despite not knowing the exact application that an organization is using,  one specific step in the Intelligence Cycle, or not worked with cloud infrastructure for three year, I can probably pick up whatever technology is being used. There are many more like me out there.
Please hire us.  
We can still get it done.

message,13,"NEWS: Donald Trump Adopts Joe Biden's Position on Ukraine and Tells Countries They are ""Going to Hell""","View this post on the web at https://aaronparnas.substack.com/p/news-donald-trump-adopts-joe-bidens

Good afternoon, everyone — what a day. First: at the U.N., Donald Trump unleashed a scorched-earth speech, practically telling the assembled nations they were “going to hell.” Then he threw a tantrum over a malfunctioning escalator — so much so that the White House is demanding an investigation into why it didn’t work for him. On foreign policy, he’s performed a total reversal on Ukraine, essentially admitting this war isn’t ending anytime soon. And the most heartbreaking item: ICE reportedly detained a 5-year-old girl with autism outside her home to bait her father out for arrest.
These are not trivial headlines — they are urgent, human stories that demand to be told, and I’m committed to telling them clearly and relentlessly. On a personal note that I’m thrilled to share: tomorrow evening I’ll be moderating the first stop of Vice President Kamala Harris’s book tour. To those coming in New York, I cannot wait to see you! I still can’t believe it — pinching myself — but I promise you won’t miss a beat: news updates will continue even while I’m on the road.
If you value fearless reporting that holds power to account and tells the stories others ignore, subscribe today. [ https://substack.com/redirect/3fd07bc0-af7b-49c3-b92a-6b601dd17234?j=eyJ1IjoiM2Nvd3cyIn0.gBvAYq-JWuxryCpqSAq7s4DN-5PW_O4Y8XoOyZ09efo ] You’ve made this work possible — we’re shaking up journalism, and I’m just getting started.
With that, here’s what you missed:
In a significant reversal of his earlier stance, President Trump declared after meeting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the U.N. General Assembly that Ukraine, backed by the European Union and NATO support, could fully restore its prewar borders by reclaiming all territory taken by Russia; he pointed to Russia’s deepening economic troubles, NATO’s continued military aid, and Ukraine’s resilience as key factors enabling such a victory, a notable shift from his prior position that land concessions might be necessary to end the war.
President Trump conceded that his personal relationship with Vladimir Putin has not helped resolve the Ukraine war, admitting he once believed his ties could end the conflict but now acknowledges “those ties mean nothing.”
In a fiery 57-minute UN General Assembly speech, President Trump mocked the UN as ineffective, blasted European allies over immigration and green energy, called climate change “the greatest con job ever,” and declared “your countries are going to hell,” while touting U.S. prosperity under his leadership; his remarks drew little applause from diplomats, veered into denial of established facts, and emphasized his MAGA agenda over multilateral cooperation, though he did pledge a new international initiative against biological weapons.
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt demanded a UN investigation after an escalator at UN headquarters abruptly stopped as President Trump and First Lady Melania stepped on it, though UN officials said the halt was caused accidentally by a safety mechanism.
U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has dissolved the Pentagon’s long-running Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services, founded in 1951, accusing it of pushing a “divisive feminist agenda” that undermines combat readiness; critics note the committee’s recommendations have historically shaped key laws and policies for women in the military, while supporters of Hegseth point to its advocacy on issues like reproductive healthcare as evidence of politicization.
A Massachusetts family alleges that ICE agents briefly held their 5-year-old autistic daughter outside their Leominster home to pressure her father, Edward Hip Mejia, into surrendering during an immigration operation; video shows the child surrounded by officers, but DHS strongly denied the claim, calling it a “disgusting smear” and accusing Mejia — a longtime U.S. resident from Guatemala with prior arrests — of abandoning his daughter while fleeing; the girl was later returned safely, and Mejia was detained two days later and is now in ICE custody.
Nexstar Media Group announced it will keep “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” off its ABC affiliate stations, joining Sinclair in refusing to air the show even as Disney restores it nationally; both station groups, together representing about 70 affiliates, cited Kimmel’s remarks about Republicans following Charlie Kirk’s killing and stressed the need for “respectful, constructive dialogue,” leaving tens of millions of U.S. viewers without broadcast access while the program remains available on Disney’s streaming platforms.
Disney announced new streaming price hikes starting Oct. 21, raising Disney+ with ads to $11.99 (up $2) and Disney+ Premium to $18.99 (up $3), with bundle prices also increasing across Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN plans; the timing follows backlash and cancellation threats over the company’s suspension of Jimmy Kimmel’s late-night show, though Disney has since reinstated him, and comes as Disney pushes its new ESPN app to drive subscribers toward bundled offerings.
Errol Musk, the 79-year-old father of Elon Musk, has been accused in a New York Times investigation of sexually abusing five of his children and stepchildren since the early 1990s, allegations he strongly denies as “false” and “nonsense”; the report, citing family members, personal correspondence, and past police inquiries, details claims of misconduct dating back to 1993, notes that multiple investigations were opened without charges, and underscores Elon Musk’s long-described estrangement from his father, whom he once characterized as capable of “a carefully thought-out plan of evil.”
With a Sept. 30 deadline looming to avoid a government shutdown, President Trump abruptly canceled a planned meeting with Democratic leaders Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries, saying their funding demands were “unserious” and that he would only negotiate if they changed course; Democrats accused him of ducking responsibility, warning Trump would “own the shutdown,” while GOP leaders Mike Johnson and John Thune reportedly urged him to call off the talks after Democrats insisted on preserving Obamacare funding.
Tuesday’s special election in Arizona’s 7th Congressional District, where Democrat Adelita Grijalva is heavily favored over Republican Daniel Butierez, is expected to give the House the decisive 218th signature needed on a bipartisan petition to force a vote on releasing the Jeffrey Epstein case files; both candidates pledged to sign, making the contest a turning point in an effort GOP leaders have tried to block, with a potential House vote as early as mid-October, though the measure would still face long odds in the Senate.
A Florida jury found Ryan Wesley Routh guilty on all counts for attempting to assassinate Donald Trump at his West Palm Beach golf course in September 2024, as well as assaulting a Secret Service agent and committing multiple firearms violations; the dramatic trial ended with Routh trying to stab himself in the neck with a pen after the verdict, while prosecutors highlighted his written note admitting intent, and Trump hailed the conviction as a “big moment for justice in America.”
Donald Trump has chosen downtown Miami as the site of his future presidential library, on land owned by Miami-Dade College near the historic Freedom Tower, a landmark tied to Cuban refugee history; the project, expected to include an adjacent hotel, marks the first presidential library paired with such a development, and will move forward pending a unanimous Florida Cabinet vote, after state lawmakers cleared legal hurdles to ensure local officials could not block construction.
Good news:
Citizen scientists in Rhode Island’s Jacob’s Point salt marsh are using makeshift “coffee filter arks” to keep endangered saltmarsh sparrow nests afloat during floods, with early results showing a dramatic reduction in chick drownings and renewed hope for the species’ survival.
Scientists in Ecuador discovered 112-million-year-old amber containing exquisitely preserved insects, spiders, and even a fragment of web—rare Southern Hemisphere “time capsules” that offer new insights into early pollinator-plant relationships during the age of Gondwana.
Twycross Zoo in the UK celebrated the birth of the nation’s only bonobo baby, a “globally significant” event that boosts conservation efforts for one of humanity’s closest and most endangered relatives.
Thanks to decades of tireless work by Professor Yang Jingyuan in China’s Shennongjia mountains, the once-dwindling golden snub-nosed monkey population has rebounded from about 500 to nearly 2,000, showing how conservation, community support, and deep understanding can save a species once on the brink.
See you in the morning.

message,23,The Complete AI Interview Guide: What Actually Works in 2025,"View this post on the web at https://natesnewsletter.substack.com/p/the-complete-ai-interview-guide-what

Last month, one of my friends got rejected from a job because of AI.
I wish I could say that was unusual. But it’s not. He took an AI interview that didn’t give him time to actually talk about his 15 years of experience in engineering, constantly interrupting him. 
At the same time, I know multiple HR teams that admit privately they are having trouble telling who to hire because candidates keep cheating at interviews.
Nobody is happy, and interviews are at the heart of the problem. 
We're in a hiring arms race where everyone's using the same weapons, and everybody's losing.
I've coached dozens of people through job applications in the age of AI—from new grads to senior directors. I've sat across from C-suite executives planning AI-integrated roles, trying to figure out what skills actually matter anymore. I've spent dozens of hours with HR teams who went from confidently screening candidates to admitting they have no idea who's real and who's reading from a screen. 
The problem is catastrophically multi-sided.
After months of watching this disaster unfold from every angle, I did what I should have done earlier: I put together my notes from conversations with everyone, dug into every tool on the market, and started exploring what prompts really worked. 
But beyond the prep and the notes, I was looking for something deeper—what philosophy of hiring and interviewing actually elevates human signal in an age when we’re all drowning in artificial noise?
What approach to interviewing actually fights the dehumanizing aspects of AI, but takes full advantage of AI as a prep guide?
The pattern that emerged isn't what the vendors are selling or what the thought leaders are preaching. The winners aren't those avoiding AI or those using it most cleverly. They're the ones who've figured out that the game has fundamentally changed—and they're playing by new rules.
What You'll Learn
For Candidates:
Why the new STAR-C interview method beats perfect STAR stories every time
The hard truth about which tools help and which are fakers
9 real in-depth AI prompts that actually prepare you for modern interviews
4 prompts to help you develop a killer interview prep routine
3 prompts to help you see how interviewers assess you—practice cheat codes!
2 prompts to help you develop the language to talk about your AI usage well
How to prepare for case studies that highlight YOUR judgement, not AI’s
When and where to use AI to win
A handy interview prep sheet you can print out and stick by the desk
For Hiring Managers:
The 3-tier AI Fluency Assessment that evaluates what actually matters
How to design interviews that reward genuine problem-solving over hidden AI assistance
Why your detection tools don't work and what to do instead
Case studies showing why great metrics can hide terrible hiring
A hiring manager prep sheet with key principles and tips for interviews
My goal is deeply practical: I want to help unstick the hiring impasse. 
I want to help you get a job in this market.
I want to help you interview better if you are hiring. 
I want you to find ways to get the signal of human talent out there so people find their best roles, and companies can find talent that’s really passionate to solve problems that matter. 
The game has changed, but my conversations have convinced me that human judgment hasn't become less valuable—it's become the whole game. The question isn't whether you use AI. It's whether you can prove you're still thinking.
Let me show you how.

Thank you for applying to the Senior Security Researcher (Job number:1821461) position at Microsoft!  We're glad you're interested in a career at Microsoft and we're here to help you find a perfect fit.
 
You may not receive feedback from us on your application directly, but please know that it’s being evaluated, and you’ll hear from us as soon as the review process is complete. If you’re selected for an interview, you’ll be notified by someone on the recruiting team.
 
You can view your application status updates through your Action Center. If you see the job moved to an Archived state, that means the position is either no longer open, you withdrew from consideration, or you were not selected for the role.
 
You may notice that we move your application from one role to another. This may happen a few times and is a normal part of our recruiting process. So, if you see the job you applied to in an Archived state, and a new job listed as Active, please know that this is normal and does not negatively impact your candidacy in any way.
 
How’s your profile?
A key part of the review process is evaluating your profile in relation to the job requirements, so please make sure your profile is accurate and extensive – it’s our first step in getting to know you! You can build your profile anyway you’d like – you can import it from LinkedIn, manually update it, or import/attach a resume. The most important thing is that your profile tells your story!
 
We encourage you to check back frequently and continue to look for opportunities that match your interests, as new jobs are being posted regularly.

After syncing with the Prime on Friday, we’re shifting our immediate focus to filling shift-based roles on the watch floor. While that unfortunately means we won’t be moving forward at this time, our teaming partner Deloitte still has a few openings tied to this contract. We recommend checking their careers page for any current roles that might be a fit.

We’ll be sure to keep your information on hand and reach out as new opportunities arise — especially as we approach the next option year.

Thanks again, and we hope to cross paths in the future.

Figure Home Equity Line is available in AK, AL, AR, AZ, CA, CO,
CT, DC, DE, FL, GA, IA, ID, IL, IN, KS, KY, LA, MA, MD, ME, MI,
MN, MO, MS, MT, NC, ND, NE, NH, NJ, NM, NV, OH, OK, OR, PA, RI,
SC, SD, TN, TX, UT, VA, VT, WA, WI, WV, and WY.          1 To
receive a gift card, you must start your application by May 29,
2025, and your loan must be approved and funded. You must apply
using the email address this offer was sent to. We cannot issue
gift cards to forwarded email addresses. It may take up to 20
business days to fulfill the gift card, which will be delivered
electronically to the email address associated with your account.
Only one gift card available per household. Amazon Gift Cards:
Restrictions apply. See Amazon.com/gc-legal for more details.

2 Our loan amounts range from a minimum of $15,000 to a maximum
of $400,000. For properties located in AK, the minimum loan
amount is $25,001 and for properties located in TX, the minimum
loan amount is $35,000. Your maximum loan amount may be lower
than $400,000, and will ultimately depend on your home value,
lien position, credit profile, verified income amount, and equity
available at the time of application. We determine home value and
resulting equity through independent data sources and automated
valuation models.

3 The Figure Home Equity Line is an open-end product where the
full loan amount (minus the origination fee) will be 100% drawn
at the time of origination. The initial amount funded at
origination will be based on a fixed rate; however, this product
contains an additional draw feature. As the borrower repays the
balance on the line, the borrower may make additional draws
during the draw period. If the borrower elects to make an
additional draw, the interest rate for that draw will be set as
of the date of the draw and will be based on an Index, which is
the Prime Rate published in the Wall Street Journal for the
calendar month preceding the date of the additional draw, plus a
fixed margin. Accordingly, the fixed rate for any additional draw
may be higher than the fixed rate for the initial draw.

4 Approval may be granted in five minutes but is ultimately
subject to verification of income and employment, as well as
verification that your property is in at least average condition
with a property condition report. Five business day funding
timeline assumes closing the loan with our remote online notary.
Funding timelines may be longer for loans secured by properties
located in counties that do not permit recording of e-signatures
or that otherwise require an in-person closing, or that require a
waiting period prior to closing.",noise
