Code Problems:

- tracker_companyalias table is empty
- tracker_atsdomain table is empty
- tracker_knowncompany table is empty
- tracker_application table is empty
- in tracker_message no messages  have been review, meaning they all need to be reviewed.
- when running main and just after a successful sync-complete, prompt for superuser username and password.
- main.py starts of ingestion even when there are no knew messages.
Admin Site Web Problems:
- Companies list shows on admin page, with clickable links, but some companies that I have applied to and have messages have no Applications or Messages.  Some of the others may or may not show any or all of its related messages.
- Under Recent Threads, sometimes du-plicate messages are shown in the thread. -- For example, Thread 196cf35eb6fa0b18 2025-05-14 10:32 — leidos Update on Leidos Position Full Spectrum Cyber AI Researcher Label: Intel 2025-05-14 10:32 — leidos Update on Leidos Position Full Spectrum Cyber AI Researcher Label: Intel
- Some messages under label_messages have "No Company", " No Body" and a non-zero confidence value. -- For example, Application Status for Cyber Machine Learning Engineer, Senior 2025-07-10 14:16 — No Company Body: Confidence: 0.51
Admin Site Upgrades:
- Build a new admin card where we can enter, modify, and update ticket status. This
- Move Ingestion section page to its own card
- Move Companies section to its own card
- Recent Mesages section needs its own card.
After hitting the "Save Labels" button, need to add to the top of the page, # messages reviewed,  #Messages Not reviewed, #Messages that were Noise, #No of Applications,  # rejections, #interviews, #valid companies, #invalid companies, average confidence score.
- These Label_Messages should be shown on the front deck of the dashboard to improve UX
