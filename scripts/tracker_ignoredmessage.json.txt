        "body": "View this post on the web at https://natesnewsletter.substack.com/p/the-complete-ai-interview-guide-what\r\n\r\nLast month, one of my friends got rejected from a job because of AI.\r\nI wish I could say that was unusual. But it’s not. He took an AI interview that didn’t give him time to actually talk about his 15 years of experience in engineering, constantly interrupting him. \r\nAt the same time, I know multiple HR teams that admit privately they are having trouble telling who to hire because candidates keep cheating at interviews.\r\nNobody is happy, and interviews are at the heart of the problem. \r\nWe're in a hiring arms race where everyone's using the same weapons, and everybody's losing.\r\nI've coached dozens of people through job applications in the age of AI—from new grads to senior directors. I've sat across from C-suite executives planning AI-integrated roles, trying to figure out what skills actually matter anymore. I've spent dozens of hours with HR teams who went from confidently screening candidates to admitting they have no idea who's real and who's reading from a screen. \r\nThe problem is catastrophically multi-sided.\r\nAfter months of watching this disaster unfold from every angle, I did what I should have done earlier: I put together my notes from conversations with everyone, dug into every tool on the market, and started exploring what prompts really worked. \r\nBut beyond the prep and the notes, I was looking for something deeper—what philosophy of hiring and interviewing actually elevates human signal in an age when we’re all drowning in artificial noise?\r\nWhat approach to interviewing actually fights the dehumanizing aspects of AI, but takes full advantage of AI as a prep guide?\r\nThe pattern that emerged isn't what the vendors are selling or what the thought leaders are preaching. The winners aren't those avoiding AI or those using it most cleverly. They're the ones who've figured out that the game has fundamentally changed—and they're playing by new rules.\r\nWhat You'll Learn\r\nFor Candidates:\r\nWhy the new STAR-C interview method beats perfect STAR stories every time\r\nThe hard truth about which tools help and which are fakers\r\n9 real in-depth AI prompts that actually prepare you for modern interviews\r\n4 prompts to help you develop a killer interview prep routine\r\n3 prompts to help you see how interviewers assess you—practice cheat codes!\r\n2 prompts to help you develop the language to talk about your AI usage well\r\nHow to prepare for case studies that highlight YOUR judgement, not AI’s\r\nWhen and where to use AI to win\r\nA handy interview prep sheet you can print out and stick by the desk\r\nFor Hiring Managers:\r\nThe 3-tier AI Fluency Assessment that evaluates what actually matters\r\nHow to design interviews that reward genuine problem-solving over hidden AI assistance\r\nWhy your detection tools don't work and what to do instead\r\nCase studies showing why great metrics can hide terrible hiring\r\nA hiring manager prep sheet with key principles and tips for interviews\r\nMy goal is deeply practical: I want to help unstick the hiring impasse. \r\nI want to help you get a job in this market.\r\nI want to help you interview better if you are hiring. \r\nI want you to find ways to get the signal of human talent out there so people find their best roles, and companies can find talent that’s really passionate to solve problems that matter. \r\nThe game has changed, but my conversations have convinced me that human judgment hasn't become less valuable—it's become the whole game. The question isn't whether you use AI. It's whether you can prove you're still thinking.\r\nLet me show you how.\r\nSubscribers get all these newsletters!...\r\n\r\nUnsubscribe https://substack.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.3EZAII6cn8-8BmnSfZHWxooHQxuOGnUNCtxslL2h30o?",

Because this moment, right now, is not politics as usual. It is an inflection point in our nation’s story. A moment that will test whether truth still has a place in American life.\r\nWhile many in the mainstream will hedge, play it safe, or stay silent, I will not.\r\nLet me be completely blunt: if they can indict two of Donald Trump’s political opponents in the past two weeks, and likely a third next week, they can do it to anyone. Some in positions of power, even inside the White House, would prefer that I be silenced next. They make that clear every single day, but especially since these recent indictments. Or worse. But we are not stopping.\r\nAnd that is where you come in. This platform does not run on corporate funding or government backing. It runs on you. Your support, your subscriptions, your voices. You have powered this from the very beginning, and with your help, we have built something real. If you are able, please subscribe today [ https://substack.com/redirect/ca9ff65c-ee5c-4c5b-9343-1ee1c00d29f9?j=eyJ1IjoiM2Nvd3cyIn0.gBvAYq-JWuxryCpqSAq7s4DN-5PW_O4Y8XoOyZ09efo ]. Every single subscription strengthens this work and keeps it alive.\r\nI know many of you are asking the same questions I hear every day. Where do we go from here? How do we ensure Americans still have access to the truth?\r\nThe answers are not simple. But I can promise you this: I am working on it.\r\nIn just the past year, our reporting has reached more than 80 million Americans. That is nearly one in four people in this country. Meanwhile, consistently, we are reaching more people daily than most major media companies, and we are doing that together. \r\nAnd that is only the beginning.\r\nI started this journey in 2022, when Russia invaded Ukraine. My family was under fire. Bombs, tanks, air raid sirens. I watched the disconnect between what they were living through and what the cable networks were reporting. So I picked up my phone and started telling the truth myself. That mission has never changed: deliver facts, not spin. Build trust, not division.\r\nAnd make no mistake: one of the greatest threats facing America right now is the collapse of civic understanding. Schools have abandoned civics education. Literacy is falling. Too many leaders care more about restricting knowledge than expanding it. That vacuum leaves an entire generation vulnerable to disinformation.\r\nSomeone asked me recently what I think it will take to fix what’s broken in America. Honestly, I believe the answer starts with stepping away from our screens and returning to real community. My generation grew up knowing our followers better than our neighbors. We were raised in a world where politics divided us before we ever learned how to connect. That’s backward. We need to relearn how to build relationships, talk face to face, and care about one another beyond hashtags and headlines.\r\nWe cannot wait for social media platforms to fix this problem. They have proven they will not. The responsibility falls to us. That is why this platform exists.\r\nI do not inject my opinions into the news. Because journalism is not about telling people what to think. It is about giving them the truth so they can think for themselves. That is why this community has grown across party lines. Republicans, Democrats, independents. They all come here for the same reason: the facts.\r\nAnd we are just getting started. The mission is to grow deliberately and responsibly. Not for scale’s sake, but to empower the next generation of journalists. To give young reporters the tools and the platform I never had, so they can bring honest reporting to their own communities.\r\nWhich brings me to this: the truth matters now more than ever. At a time when hate is rewarded with clicks and division is treated like currency, we need strong, independent voices to cut through the noise. Facts are not optional. They are the foundation of democracy. And when we abandon them, we abandon ourselves.\r\nThat is why I will never give in to pressure to spread false narratives. I will not compromise independence for approval. I will take the hits, I will face the attacks, and I will keep showing up for you every single day. Because truth matters. And without it, there is nothing left to hold us together.\r\nBut here is the thing. We all need to breathe. Tonight, I am unplugging, and I hope you do too. The next several days will be intense, and I will be here covering the news for you when it matters most. But right now, your mind and your spirit need rest.\r\nI know you are tired. I know you are anxious and afraid. But you are not alone. Together, we will push back against the chaos, and together, we will make sure that truth prevails.\r\nAmerica faces many problems, but at the top of that list is the collapse of trust in the media. I am trying to rebuild that. One video. One post. One fact at a time. And it is working.\r\nWe are less than one year in.\r\nTogether, we can keep building.

Each on its own would be troubling. Together, they reveal an accelerating pattern of authoritarian behavior from the Trump White House.\r\nThe first involves a senior White House official, on live television, invoking the phrase “plenary authority” before abruptly freezing, hinting at limitless presidential power to deploy the military inside the United States. The second is a sitting president demanding that a governor and a mayor be jailed for opposing him. The third is that same president calling for a U.S. senator to be silenced and investigated for criticizing him.\r\nBefore we dig in, take a moment to support independent journalism that refuses to look away. The normalization of extremism thrives in silence. Subscribe [ https://substack.com/redirect/3842bb57-c323-48f2-8646-68705698f0a4?j=eyJ1IjoiM2Nvd3cyIn0.gBvAYq-JWuxryCpqSAq7s4DN-5PW_O4Y8XoOyZ09efo ], share, and stand with reporting that calls out power, questions authority, and defends democracy.\r\n1. Stephen Miller’s “Glitch” and the Language of Unlimited Power\r\nFirst, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller appeared on CNN to defend President Donald Trump’s deployment of National Guard troops to U.S. cities, including Portland and Chicago, over the objections of state officials.\r\nWhen asked whether the administration would comply with a judge’s order blocking troop deployment in Oregon, Miller said the White House had appealed and then declared, “Under Title 10 of the U.S. Code, the President has plenary authority, has,” before abruptly freezing mid-sentence. The screen cut out.\r\nCNN’s anchor Boris Sanchez apologized, citing a “technical issue.” When the feed resumed, the conversation had shifted away from Miller’s statement.\r\nBut the internet noticed. Within hours, “plenary authority” was trending on social media, with many speculating that Miller had accidentally revealed more than he intended. The term, defined by Cornell Law as “broadly construed and practically limitless power,” carries dangerous implications, especially in the context of a president who has already hinted at invoking the Insurrection Act to use the U.S. military domestically.\r\nWhether Miller froze because of a glitch or a guilty conscience, the message was clear. This White House is testing how far it can stretch executive power inside the country’s own borders.\r\n2. Trump Calls for the Arrest of Illinois Leaders\r\nJust one day later, President Trump took to Truth Social to call for the imprisonment of Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, claiming they had “failed to protect ICE officers.”\r\nThe outburst came as federalized National Guard troops arrived in Illinois, an unprecedented move opposed by both state and local officials. Trump’s rhetoric escalated beyond political dispute into outright threats, writing that both men “should be in jail.”\r\nGovernor Pritzker responded forcefully, accusing Trump of “calling for the arrest of elected representatives checking his power.” He warned that this is what the path to “full-blown authoritarianism” looks like. Mayor Johnson added pointedly, “This is not the first time Trump has tried to have a Black man unjustly arrested.”\r\nIt is worth remembering that the use of the U.S. military against domestic leaders is forbidden under most interpretations of the Constitution and the Posse Comitatus Act. But Trump’s team, as Miller’s comments suggest, appears to believe the president’s “plenary authority” can override that.\r\n3. Trump’s Push to Silence Senator Richard Blumenthal\r\nFinally, Trump again targeted a political opponent, this time Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal, demanding that he be “silenced and investigated” over decades-old questions about his military record.\r\nIn a Truth Social post, Trump derided Blumenthal as “Da Nang Dick,” reviving a scandal from 2010 when the senator apologized for misrepresenting his service “in” Vietnam instead of “during” it. Trump claimed Blumenthal was a “fraud” who “should be allowed to speak no longer,” an extraordinary statement from a sitting president calling to suppress the voice of an elected U.S. senator.\r\n4. The War on Speech and Protest\r\nTrump’s latest comments go beyond authoritarian rhetoric—they strike at the heart of the First Amendment.\r\nAt a White House roundtable, Trump said flatly that his administration “took the freedom of speech away” when addressing flag burning. He then doubled down, promising, “I’d love to do something about that,” when told of a planned protest in Austin.\r\nMoments later, activist Nick Sortor told Trump she had seized a burning flag from a protester. Trump asked, “Do you know who he is?” and when Sortor said yes, he replied, “So why don’t you give it to Pam. Give it to the attorney general and we’ll start prosecutions.”\r\nEach of these stories might seem like just another episode in the chaotic Trump news cycle. But taken together, they form a clear pattern, one that should alarm anyone who believes in constitutional government.\r\nA senior White House official asserts the president has “limitless” power to deploy the military domestically.\r\nThe president calls for the imprisonment of elected officials who oppose him.\r\nThat same president demands the silencing and investigation of a sitting senator.\r\nThese are not the actions of a leader committed to democracy or the rule of law. They are the actions of a man inching closer to unrestrained, autocratic power, and of an administration increasingly comfortable saying the quiet part out loud.\r\nFor years, critics have warned that Trump’s second term would bring an open embrace of authoritarianism. In just one day, we have seen evidence of that prophecy unfolding in real time.\r\n\r\nUnsubscribe https://substack.com/redirect/2/eyJlIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9hYXJvbnBhcm5hcy5zdWJzdGFjay5jb20vYWN0aW9uL2Rpc2FibGVfZW1haWw_dG9rZW49ZXlKMWMyVnlYMmxrSWpveU1ESTNNVFl5T1RBc0luQnZjM1JmYVdRaU9qRTNOVFkwTmpVd01pd2lhV0YwSWpveE56VTVPVFk0TkRrekxDSmxlSEFpT2pFM09URTFNRFEwT1RNc0ltbHpjeUk2SW5CMVlpMHhPREV3TVRZMElpd2ljM1ZpSWpvaVpHbHpZV0pzWlY5bGJXRnBiQ0o5LkpWYUlyY1ozZDNVTnpaMUJRckI1TGU4RkNOazZIOEl6Qm9jcWdMeU5PRkUiLCJwIjoxNzU2NDY1MDIsInMiOjE4MTAxNjQsImYiOmZhbHNlLCJ1IjoyMDI3MTYyOTAsImlhdCI6MTc1OTk2ODQ5MywiZXhwIjoyMDc1NTQ0NDkzLCJpc3MiOiJwdWItMCIsInN1YiI6ImxpbmstcmVkaXJlY3QifQ.3vE_Pt5UPShr32YpbWddYRbvC0GPLeijpv-e3Ezse98?",

Google launched an AI vulnerability rewards program and its CodeMender AI agent to automatically fix open-source vulnerabilities. The U.S. government shutdown has crippled CISA operations and allowed the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act to expire. California passed a first-of-its-kind AI transparency law, while CrowdStrike acquired Pangea to launch its AI Detection and Response (AIDR) platform. Europe is still recovering from a Collins Aerospace ransomware incident that grounded airports, and Microsoft is expanding Security Copilot into a full Agentic SOC model. 📌 This Week's Topics 🤖 Google launches AI Vulnerability Rewards Program and CodeMender 🏛️ U.S. government shutdown impacts CISA and cyber intel sharing 📜 California passes AI safety transparency and disclosure law 🦅 CrowdStrike launches AI Detection & Response after Pangea acquisition ✈️ Ransomware disrupts Collins Aerospace airport systems 🧩 Gemini AI vulnerabilities expose assistant guardrail weaknesses ⚙️ Action plan and recommendations for the week Let’s dive in. 👇 🚨 Critical AI Security Incidents 🤖 Google launches AI Vulnerability Reward Program and CodeMender Google introduced a new AI Vulnerability Reward Program (AI VRP) offering payouts up to $30,000 for researchers who identify exploitable security flaws in AI systems. The program covers model misuse, prompt injection, data leakage, and unsafe integrations. At the same time, Google released CodeMender, an AI agent that automatically detects and patches vulnerabilities in open-source projects. Both initiatives reflect Google’s broader Secure AI Framework (SAIF 2.0) push to make AI development more resilient.
