 * In 2025, the Premium Savings Account from Morgan Stanley Private Bank rated "Best Savings Account for Investors 2025" by Buy Side from Wall Street Journal. To choose Buy Side from WSJ's best high-yield savings accounts, WSJ considered the following factors: accounts offering the highest annual percentage yields (APYs) on deposited funds, accounts without monthly maintenance fees, or with easily waivable fees, and prioritized accounts without high balance and deposit requirements over those with high minimums (though in some cases, APYs are competitive enough to justify high minimums), accessibility, user-friendliness of banking platforms and the customer reputations of the banking institutions that offer these accounts. Reprinted with permission by Dow Jones Company, Inc.
 


 To determine rankings for the Best CD Accounts of 2025, GOBankingRates considered the following factors (excluding neobanks): (1) total assets as sourced from the FDIC; (2) number of branch locations as sourced from the FDIC; (3) minimum deposit to open an account; (4) 12-month CD APY rate; (5) 60-month CD APY rate, and (6) the average mobile app rating between the Google Play (Android) and Apple stores. All factors were then scored and combined, with the lowest score being the best. Factors (1) and (2) were weighed 0.5 times, factor (3) was weighed 2 times, and factors (4) and (5) were weighed 4 times. All products and offerings had to be available as of Nov. 1, 2024, to be considered. Rates are subject to change; unless otherwise noted, rates are updated periodically. All other
 information on accounts is accurate as of Dec. 9, 2024.
 


 To determine the Best Online Banks of 2025, GOBankingRates looked at the following factors across exclusively online banks: (1) total assets as sourced from the FDIC; (2) monthly checking fee ratio (percent the minimum to avoid fee compared to the monthly fee itself); (3) savings APY; (4) 1-year CD APY; (5) Bauer rating (out of 5 stars); (6) products/services offered (auto loans, mortgage loans, credit cards, investment services, and insurance); and (7) the average mobile app rating between the Google Play (Android) and Apple stores. Factors (1) and (2) were weighed 0.5 times, and factors (3) and (7) were weighed 2 times. For all savings and checking account data, only the basic accounts or products offered at each institution were analyzed. All products and offerings had to be available
 as of Nov. 1, 2024, to be considered. Rates are subject to change; unless otherwise noted, rates are updated periodically. All other information on accounts is accurate as of Dec. 9, 2024
 


 
 1. In the following disclosure, the words “we”, us”, and “Bank”, refer to Morgan Stanley Private Bank, National Association, Member FDIC ("Morgan Stanley Private Bank"). 

ELIGIBILITY AND LIMITATIONS:


 To take advantage of this offer, you must be the original recipient of the offer email from us. 
 


 This offer is only valid for a new Premium Savings Account (PSA). This offer is not valid for Checking, Max-Rate Checking or line of credit, or other accounts that we or our affiliates offer. IRA and non-IRA Brokerage accounts are ineligible. This offer is only eligible to one new opened and funded Premium Savings Account (PSA) within 30 days. Excludes non-U.S. residents, and residents of any jurisdiction where this offer is not valid. 


 Each customer is limited to a lifetime maximum of two new PSA offers. 


 Other restrictions may apply.
 

OFFER RULES FOR ALL PARTICIPANTS:

 1. Open Account: Open one new Premium Savings Account between 11/07/2025 and 2/28/2026. No minimum initial deposit is required to open an account; however, the account must be funded within thirty (30) days to remain open. 

 
 
 2. Deposit Funds: Deposit a minimum of $25,000 or more in net-new funds* over the first thirty (30) days following account opening (“Deposit Period”). At the end of the Deposit Period, all net new funds will be totaled to determine which Deposit Tier you have satisfied (see below). Net-new funds do not include any deposits transferred from accounts provided by us (e.g. Checking, Max-Rate Checking), or any of our affiliates. 
 
 

Bonus ChartDeposit TierMinimum Maintenance BalanceCash Credit Tier
$25,000 - $49,999$25,000$250
$50,000 - $74,999$50,000$500
$75,000 - $99,999$75,000$750
$100,000 or more$100,000$1,000


 
 3. Maintain Balance: Maintain an average daily balance in your enrolled Premium Savings Account that meets the Minimum Maintenance Balance of the Deposit Tier you have satisfied in Step 2. The average daily balance calculation will begin from Day thirty (30) of account opening and will end forty-five (45) days following (“Maintenance Period”). 
 


 
 4. Receive Bonus: After the requirements are satisfied, we will deposit the bonus within thirty (30) days following the end of the Maintenance Period. The bonus will correspond to the Cash Credit Tier for which you qualify, based on the amount deposited during the Deposit Period and maintained during the Maintenance Period. If the Deposit Tier is higher than what is maintained over the Maintenance Period, or vice versa, you will qualify for the lower Cash Credit Tier. Please see below for an example.
 

Example: Please see below for an example of how you can earn a cash bonus. 


 
 1. You open your Premium Savings account between 11/07/2025 and 2/28/2026. 


 
 2. Within thirty (30) days of account opening (the Deposit Period), you deposit $50,000 - $74,999,000 in net new funds.


 
 3. For the forty-five (45) days immediately following the Deposit Period (the Maintenance Period), you maintain an average daily balance of at least $50,000. 
 


 4. The successful completion of Steps 1, 2 and 3 qualify you for a cash credit of $500. However, let’s say your average daily balance during the Maintenance Period drops between $25,000 - $49,999. In this case, you would only receive $250, notwithstanding your $50,000 deposit during the Deposit Period.

        * In 2025, the Premium Savings Account from Morgan Stanley Private Bank rated "Best Savings Account for Investors 2025" by Buy Side from Wall Street Journal. To choose Buy Side from WSJ's best high-yield savings accounts, WSJ considered the following factors: accounts offering the highest annual percentage yields (APYs) on deposited funds, accounts without monthly maintenance fees, or with easily waivable fees, and prioritized accounts without high balance and deposit requirements over those with high minimums (though in some cases, APYs are competitive enough to justify high minimums), accessibility, user-friendliness of banking platforms and the customer reputations of the banking institutions that offer these accounts. Reprinted with permission by Dow Jones Company, Inc.
  <br><br>
  To determine rankings for the Best CD Accounts of 2025, GOBankingRates considered the following factors (excluding neobanks): (1) total assets as sourced from the FDIC; (2) number of branch locations as sourced from the FDIC; (3) minimum deposit to open an account; (4) 12-month CD APY rate; (5) 60-month CD APY rate, and (6) the average mobile app rating between the Google Play (Android) and Apple stores. All factors were then scored and combined, with the lowest score being the best. Factors (1) and (2) were weighed 0.5 times, factor (3) was weighed 2 times, and factors (4) and (5) were weighed 4 times. All products and offerings had to be available as of Nov. 1, 2024, to be considered. Rates are subject to change; unless otherwise noted, rates are updated periodically. All other
 information on accounts is accurate as of Dec. 9, 2024.

  To determine the Best Online Banks of 2025, GOBankingRates looked at the following factors across exclusively online banks: (1) total assets as sourced from the FDIC; (2) monthly checking fee ratio (percent the minimum to avoid fee compared to the monthly fee itself); (3) savings APY; (4) 1-year CD APY; (5) Bauer rating (out of 5 stars); (6) products/services offered (auto loans, mortgage loans, credit cards, investment services, and insurance); and (7) the average mobile app rating between the Google Play (Android) and Apple stores. Factors (1) and (2) were weighed 0.5 times, and factors (3) and (7) were weighed 2 times. For all savings and checking account data, only the basic accounts or products offered at each institution were analyzed. All products and offerings had to be
 available as of Nov. 1, 2024, to be considered. Rates are subject to change; unless otherwise noted, rates are updated periodically. All other information on accounts is accurate as of Dec. 9, 2024

        3. <u>Maintain Balance</u>: Maintain an average daily balance in your enrolled Premium Savings Account that meets the Minimum Maintenance Balance of the Deposit Tier you have satisfied in Step 2. The average daily balance calculation will begin from Day thirty (30) of account opening and will end forty-five (45) days following (“Maintenance Period”). 
  <br><br>
  
  4. <u>Receive Bonus</u>: After the requirements are satisfied, we will deposit the bonus within thirty (30) days following the end of the Maintenance Period. The bonus will correspond to the Cash Credit Tier for which you qualify, based on the amount deposited during the Deposit Period and maintained during the Maintenance Period. If the Deposit Tier is higher than what is maintained over the Maintenance Period, or vice versa, you will qualify for the lower Cash Credit Tier. Please see below for an example.
  <br><br>
  <b>Example:</b> Please see below for an example of how you can earn a cash bonus. <br><br>
  
  1. You open your Premium Savings account between 11/07/2025 and 2/28/2026. <br><br>
  
  2. Within thirty (30) days of account opening (the Deposit Period), you deposit <b>$50,000 - $74,999,000</b> in <b>net new funds.</b> <br><br>
  
  3. For the forty-five (45) days immediately following the Deposit Period (the Maintenance Period), you maintain an average daily balance of at least <b>$50,000</b>. 
  <br><br>
  4. The successful completion of Steps 1, 2 and 3 qualify you for a cash credit of $500. However, let’s say your average daily balance during the Maintenance Period drops between $25,000 - $49,999. In this case, you would only receive $250, notwithstanding your $50,000 deposit during the Deposit Period.   
  <br><br>
  The applicable cash credit tier will be determined following the close of the Maintenance Period and will be paid out within thirty (30) days after the Maintenance Period (or one hundred and five (105) days following account opening). Cash credits will be paid to the account where the deposit is made.
  <br><br>

A withdrawal will reduce earnings. See the CD Rate Table page at <a href="https://click.e.etradefinancial.com/?qs=2f44107b33068a9e156e59810b0cda442d0b505ab8d93b1943287d4c8090f655a829e78eaeb4a056c66c7fd2101390e86f9c5ec4fcca51e3" target="_blank" style="color:#555;text-decoration:underline;">etrade.com
</a> for information on term lengths, current interest rates and corresponding APYs. Certificate of Deposit rates are subject to change at any time and are not guaranteed until the CD is funded and settled.  
<br><br>
Interest is compounded daily. Interest will compound from the Settlement Date until the last full day before the date of withdrawal using the daily balance method. Accrued interest posts to your account on a quarterly basis, unless you select at account opening to receive interest via check.
